# Hive

A personal attempt at home automation using microservices.

**rules/goals**
- Seperate concerns.
- Keep code-bases small.
- Containerize all services.

**base services**
- Registry - configuration and assets.
- Storage - data persistance.
- Web UI - visual UI.
- Core - automation of all controllers.
- Controllers - control different components.

## Running

Use the *docker-compose.yml* to run all services and setup everything.
